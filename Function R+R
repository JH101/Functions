#Reading and Research - Functions

These tasks are designed to introduce you to the programming topic we will be studying in class next lesson. You **must** complete these activities prior to the lesson.

##Functions
A function is a way of segmenting code into manageable pieces, so that it can be used again and again. Creating functions cuts the size of scripts and makes them easier to understand.

You have been using functions since you started learning Python. Two of the most common are `input()` and `print()`.

When a function is used in the main body of your program it is called a function call. You can recognise a function call as it has the following features:

##Parameters
Most functions work on some data that is provided by the main program. The data is passed from the main program to the function by putting it between the brackets of the function call. Multiple pieces of data are separated with commas. These pieces of data are the **parameters** of the function.

A function can have **zero or more parameters**. If it has zero parameters, the brackets are empty.

##Built-in functions
The Python interpreter has a number of functions and types built into it that are always available. You have already met a number of these.

###Task 1
Use the Python shell to investigate the built-in functions below and complete the table.

|Code|Result|Description of function|
|----|------|-----------------------|
|`round(3.87)`|4 |rounds to the nearest whole number |
|`round(3.5)`|4| ''|
|`round(4.5)`|4 |'' |
|`round(5.78,1)`|5.8 |round to the nearst 10th |
|`str(7)`|'7' |converts it to a string data type |
|`str(7.65)`|'7.65' |'' |
|`len("Computing")`|9 |outputs the length of the string |
|`type(7)`|class 'int' | outputs the data type |
|`type("7")`|class 'string' |'' |
|`chr(97)`|'a' |ouputs the ascii character assosciated with the number |
|`ord("a")`|'97' |outputs the ascii number associated with the letter |

##String Functions
Python has a number of built-in functions that allow a programmer to manipulate text strings.

###Task 2
Find out what each of the string functions in the table below does to a text string variable with the identifier msg. You will need to assign msg a value that is a string with a mix of upper and lower case letters and multiple words and then explore the effects of each of the functions.

|Function|Effect it has on text string|
|--------|----------------------------|
|`msg.upper()`|'FISH AND CHIPS" |
|`msg.lower()`|"fish and chips" |
|`msg.capitalize()`|"Fish and Chips" |
|`msg.title()`|"Fish And Chips" |

###Task 3

1. Write a program that reads in a string and displays the number of characters in the string.
2. Write a program that displays the ASCII code for any given character.
3. Write a program that will display the character for any given ASCII code.

Paste your code and screenshots of running your programs in the space below

```python
string = input("Please enter a string")

length = len(string)

print("the length of your string is {0}".format(length))


#question 1
```

```python
#question 2
character = input("Please enter a character: ")

code = ord(character)

print("The code for {0} is {1}".format(character, code))


```

```python
#question 3
code = int(input("Please enter an ACII code: "))

character = chr(code)

print("The character for {0} is {1}".format(code, character))


```

##Importing Modules
A module is a group of functions that programmers have packaged together for people to use. To use a module in your code you must import it into your program.

You do this by adding a line at the top of your program e.g.   

`import math`

When calling a function that is part of a module you need to prefix the function name with the module identifier, using dot notation e.g.

`math.trunc(my_float)`

###Task 4

1. Use the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) to find out about the functions in the table below

    |Math Function|Description|
    |-------------|-----------|
    |`math.trunc(3.14159)`|Rounds to the nearest whole number  |
    |`math.pi`|the value of pi|
    |`round(math.pi, 3)`|the value of pi to 3 decimal places|

2. Using the Python documentation, identify two other useful functions in the math module, briefly describe what each does and give a brief example of the purpose of a program that might use this function.

    |Math Function|Description|Program that would use it|
    |-------------|-----------|-------------------------|
    |Factorial(n) |calculates the factorial value for that number |calculator program |
    |sqrt(n) |calculates the sqaure root of that number |calculator program |

##Using Built-in Functions and Modules
Let's consider some code that uses some of the built-in functions that you have been investigating.

###Task 5
Without entering the code into Python, try to explain what the code below does. You will need to explain each of the different sections of the program by **adding comments** to the program.

```python
import math

number_to_change = float(input("Please enter a number to 3 or more decimal places: "))
number_one = math.trunc(number_to_change) #Rounds the number inputted to the nearst whole number
number_two = round(number_to_change,2)#Rounds the number to 2 decimnal places

print("The integer part of your number is {0}.".format(number_one))#Prints the nearest whole number that was inputted
print("The number to two decimal places is {0}.".format(number_two))#prints the number rounded to the nearest 2 numbers
```

##Structured programming
Read **pages 84 and 85** of AS Computing by Bond and Langfield which describe structure tables and hierarchy charts.

###Task 6
Complete the following statements about structure tables

1. A structure table shows how a problem can be broken down into subproblems
2. The steps involved in solving a problem are written as modules

Consider this problem:

####Roasting Time For Chickens
*A program is needed that works out the cooking time for roasting a chicken. The time required is 30 minutes for every 500g plus 30 minutes. If the chicken is stuffed, it needs an extra 30 minutes. The user enters the weight of the chicken in grams and whether it is stuffed, and the program calculates the approximate time it should be roasted for in hours and minutes.*

The problem above can be divided into simpler sub-problems that make writing the program easier:

- Get weight of chicken from user.
- Get whether chicken is stuffed or not from user.
- Calculate total roasting time.
- Display roasting time.

The third sub-problem, calculating the total roasting time, involves some sub-problems itself:

- Calculate roasting time for weight in minutes.
- Add additional 30 minutes required.
- Add time if chicken is stuffed (further 30 minutes).
- Convert minutes cooking time to hours and minutes.

###Task 7
Produce a structure table for the **Roasting time for chickens** problem.

0. Work out the time needed to cook a chicken
0.1-How big is the chicken?(g)
0.2-is it stuffed?
0.3-calculate time
0.3.1-add 30 min for every 500g of weight
0.3.2-add 30 min if it is stuffed

###Task 8
Draw a hierarchy chart for the 'Roasting time for chickens' problem.

##Summary
In this R&R you have investigated built-in functions and importing modules. You have seen the basic structure of a function call and how parameters can be passed to a function. You have also seen how to import modules so that their functions are available in your program. You have investigated functions in the random module and the math module.

You have also explored structure tables and hierarchy charts. These are approaches to program design that help in the breakdown of more complex problems into sub-problems. This makes it easier to develop programs to address more complex problems.

Please make sure you have completed this R&R fully before your next programming lesson as it will form the basis of the initial classroom discussion and starter tasks.
